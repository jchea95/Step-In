# Step-In

Step In is an immersive installation of artistic space to encourage empathy building, enlightenment, and understanding in the form of a human puzzle game. This space is created by a projector and a Microsoft Kinect One. Using Processing software, technology is blended with art as my personal art is incorporated as each of the puzzleâ€™s settings, and code is used to produce an environment that encourages higher thinking on sensitive subjects. It is designed to intermix reality with art work to produce a unique experience for each individual user.
