Step In is an immersive installation of artistic space to encourage empathy building, enlightenment, and understanding in the form of a human puzzle game. This space is created by a projector and a Microsoft Kinect One. Using Processing software, technology is blended with art as my personal art is incorporated as each of the puzzle’s settings, and code is used to produce an environment that encourages higher thinking on sensitive subjects. It is designed to intermix reality with art work to produce a unique experience for each individual user.
